# Roman HLIS Cosmology PIT's Pipeline Deliverable Reports Document

This is a template LaTeX documet repo that syncs with Overleaf.

## Purpose

This document is a template for the (Roman High-latitude Imaging Survey's Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team)[https://roman-hlis-cosmology.caltech.edu]. 

## Scope

This document can be used as a template for team documents or papers. Feel free to do with it as you please! 

## Approach aka Instructions

This is a TeX document owned by the Roman HLIS PIT Pipeline Manager team. It is mirrored as a repository in (our GitHub Organisation)[https://github.com/Roman-HLIS-Cosmology-PIT's repo in order to facilitate history tracking as well as local editing. It is also a document in Overleaf, which mirrors the GitHub repo.

It is recommended that documents larger than a couple of pages are split into auxiliary files (nicely organised into folders if needed) and that the `main.tex` file does not contain any or much content text - but that it is reserved mostly for the introductory text (aka this) and `input` statements. This is especially useful for documents on which many people are collaborating. Read (more about this on the Overleaf documentation)[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Management_in_a_large_project], if you are interested.
