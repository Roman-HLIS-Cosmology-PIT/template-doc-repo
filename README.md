# Roman HLIS Cosmology PIT's Document template

This is a template LaTeX documet repo that syncs with Overleaf.

## Purpose

This document is a template for the [Roman High-latitude Imaging Survey's Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team](https://roman-hlis-cosmology.caltech.edu). 

Please contact the [Dida Markovic](https://app.slack.com/client/T0LFK1FRC/DPXEZHAAJ) if you encounter any technical problems, have any questions or comments, or if you want to help improve this template. Thanks!

## Scope

This document can be used as a template for team documents or papers. Feel free to do with it as you please! 

## Approach aka Instructions

This is a TeX document owned by the Roman HLIS PIT Pipeline Manager team. It is mirrored as a repository in [our GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/Roman-HLIS-Cosmology-PIT)'s repo in order to facilitate history tracking as well as local editing. It is also a document in Overleaf, which mirrors the GitHub repo.

It is recommended that documents larger than a couple of pages are split into auxiliary files (nicely organised into folders if needed) and that the `main.tex` file does not contain any or much content text - but that it is reserved mostly for the introductory text (aka this) and `input` statements. This is especially useful for documents on which many people are collaborating. Read [more about this on the Overleaf documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Management_in_a_large_project), if you are interested.

### How to connect to Overleaf

Link your Overleaf account with GitHub.

1. Create a `New Project` on Overleaf -> `Import from GitHub`.
2. Best practice is to name it the same as your long, human-readable title of the repo.
3. Scroll to find the repo you are importing and click the Import button.
4. Click on Menu (top left) -> GitHub to `Sync`, which creates a new git commit to the GitHub repo.

Note that it is possible to do this in a different way, where the Overleaf is a remote repo just like the one on GitHub. This is a valid choice if you are a git pro. The advantage is that you have more control over the commits. We recommend you chose the easy option above, unless you are set on making your life complicated. Note that the two choices are not exclusive and you can do both at the same time.
