\section{About this document}

\subsection{Purpose}

This document is a template for the \href{https://roman-hlis-cosmology.caltech.edu/}{Roman High-latitude Imaging Survey's Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team} whose work plan is described in our proposal \citep{proposal}. 

\subsection{Scope}

This document can be used as a template for team documents or papers. Feel free to do with it as you please! 

\subsection{Approach aka Instructions}

This is a \TeX\ document owned by the Roman HLIS PIT Pipeline Manager team. It is mirrored as a repository in \href{https://github.com/Roman-HLIS-Cosmology-PIT}{our GitHub Organisation}'s repo in order to facilitate history tracking as well as local editing. It is also a document in Overleaf, which mirrors the GitHub repo.

It is recommended that documents larger than a couple of pages are split into auxiliary files (nicely organised into folders if needed) and that the \texttt{main.tex} file does not contain any or much content text - but that it is reserved mostly for the introductory text (aka this) and \texttt{input} statements. This is especially useful for documents on which many people are collaborating. Read \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Management_in_a_large_project}{more about this on the Overleaf documentation}, if you are interested.
